A first program, demonstrating how to assemble and run code

<p>
In this first example I will outline the most fundamental concepts of
assembler programming, and explain how to assemble and run the
simplest possible example. 
</p>
<h3>Overview -- what assembly language is and does</h3>
<p>
At the most fundamental level, a computer's CPU processes <i>machine language</i> or <i>machine code</i> instructions -- these terms mean essentially 
the same thing. Machine language is a set of numeric codes which the CPU
follows in a well-defined sequence, and which tell the CPU what to do.
The CPU operates at a level of fine detail: instructions specify how
to pass data between registers, where and how to read and write 
memory, and very basic arithmetic operations. A program of any complexity
has to be built up from these very fundamental operations -- usually
a large number of them.
</p>
<p>
It's very difficult for humans to read numerical instructions, so we
typically use an <i>assembler</i> to convert <i>assembly language</i> to
machine code. Assembly language is symbolic -- words are used rather than
numbers to specify operations. However, there's a more-or-less direct mapping
from assembly language to machine code. While the assembler will provide
facilities that simplify coding, it's still necessary to specify the
CPU's behavior in very fine detail. Programmers used to working in 
high-level languages tend to find working at such a low
level rather frustrating; but the key to programming successfully
in assembly language is much the same as for any kind of
procedural programming: build up a complex program from a number
of simpler parts. Assembler programming allows for functions calls,
local variables, loop constructs, data structures, and most of
the paradigms that high-level languages enjoy. You just have to
implement them yourself.
</p>
<p>
<b>A note about C</b>. You don't need to have programmed in C to be
able to program in assembly language. I started programming in assembly 
years before I even heard of C. However, there's no escaping the fact
that the Linux kernel is largely implemented in C, and follows
C conventions for representing data. These conventions are embodied
in the assembler as well.  
</p>
<p>
In order to follow the examples in this series of articles, you will need 
four things:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p><i>A Raspberry Pi 3 or 4, or some other ARM-based Linux system.</i>
 The examples all work on modern ARM-based Android devices. In fact, they
are <i>binary compatible</i>, meaning that the generated machine code will be
transferable between devices. Binary compatibility is quite hard to 
ensure between Linux devices, but all my examples are simple enough to make it possible. Installing and running an assembler on Android is no 
simple matter, but it's trivially easy on a Pi.</p></li>
<li><p><i>An assembler that uses the GNU syntax.</i> There are many
assemblers, some free and open-source, some commercial. Some have fancy
graphical user interfaces and built-in debugging tools. The GNU assembler
is a much simpler tool -- it takes a file containing assembly language 
instructions, and generates binary machine code. However, any assembler
that uses the GNU syntax will work for these examples, however complex
or rudimentary it may be. </p></li>
<li><p>A <i>text editor</i> -- nano, vi, emacs, whatever. If you have a fancy 
assembler with a built-in editor, then of course you could use that. However, all my instructions are based on simple, plain text source files. The
GNU assembler is part of the <code>binutils</code> package in Debian-based
Raspberry Pi Linux distributions -- <code>sudo apt-get install binutils</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>A <i>linker</i>. The linker has a significant role in C programming,
but a much more limited one in most assembly programs. In my examples, all
the linker does is convert <i>object files</i> into <i>executables</i>. Both
of these kinds of file contain exactly the same machine code, but the 
file formats are just a little different.  The GNU linker is a program
called <code>ld</code>, and will probably be in the same package as
the assembler. Again, integrated development tools automate linking and
assembling, but
I think it is more educational to do it manually.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>
To follow my examples, you need to be comfortable working with command-line
tools, in a terminal. Or, alternatively, you need to be willing to 
adapt the examples to work with a development environment that is more to your 
taste. There are many such environments, but I can't comment on them
or give instructions, because I don't use any myself.
</p>

<h3>The example -- a program that starts and just stops</h3>

<p>
This is the simplest example I could come up with. It's not even
"Hello, world". In fact, it will take several more examples to build
up to the Hello, World stage. In this example, the program will start,
and stop with an exit code that you can examine on the command line. 
Examining the exit code will allow you to verify that the program
actually did something, even if it didn't do very much.
</p>
<p>
Here is the example; I will assume it is saved in file called 
<code>01_exit.as</code>. The use of the suffix <code>.as</code> is
pretty typical for assembly code. I will explain what the various
instructions mean, after demonstrating how to assemble and link
the program.
</p>

<pre class="codeblock" lang="asm">
// Set exit value to a literal number, by invoking sys_exit
.text

.global _start

_start:
    mov    %r0, $42    
    mov    %r7, $1     // sys_exit is syscall #1
    swi    $0          // invoke syscall 
</pre>

<h3>Assembling the example</h3>

<p>
All the examples in this series can be processed in the same way, since
all consist of a single assembler source file. 
</p>

<pre class="sh">
$ as -o 01_exit.o 01_exit.as
$ ld -o 01_exit.bin 01_exit.o 
</pre>

<p>
The first line assembles the file <code>01_exit.as</code> to the
<i>object file</i> <code>01_exit.o</code>. This is the file that
contains the machine code, but it is not quite in a format suitable
to be executed. The second line, using <code>ld</code>, makes the
conversion to an executable file-- its main job in 
this case is to indicate to Linux
the starting address of the program. This is the symbol <code>_start</code>,
as I shall explain.
</p>
<p>
Both <code>as</code> and <code>ld</code> take an <code>-o</code> argument,
to set the output filename. It's conventional to use filenames ending
in <code>.o</code> for object files. There's no convention for 
executables -- they usually don't have a suffix. However, I'm using
the suffix <code>.bin</code> ("binary") in all my examples. This is
just to make it easier to manage the files, and doesn't affect operation.
</p>
<p>
To run the example at the command line (and there really is no
other way at this stage):
</p>
<pre class="sh">
$ ./01_exit.bin 
$ echo $?
42 
</pre>

<p>
<code>$?</code> is replaced with the exit code from the previous
program. Since all this example does is set the exit code to 42,
the only way to tell it has worked is to look at the exit code.
Later we'll examine examples that produce more immediate output.
</p>

<h3>Examining the example code</h3>
<p>
Let's look at the code, line by line.
</p>
<pre class="codeblock" lang="asm">
// Set exit value to a literal number, by invoking sys_exit
</pre>
<p>
This is a comment. It has no meaning to the assembler -- it is for the 
guidance of human readers. Careful use of comments is generally a good 
idea in all forms of programming, but crucial in assembly language. 
</p>
<p>
The GNU assembler accepts various different flavours of comment. Single
line comments can be introduced using <code>@</code> or <code>#</code>.
Multi-line comments use the form <code>/*...*/</code>, as in C and Java.
</p>

<pre class="codeblock" lang="asm">
.text
</pre>

<p>
<code>.text</code> is the type name of a <code>section</code>. You'll also
see the term <code>segment</code> used in some documents. 
The section type denotes
the type of content that follows: <code>.text</code> is conventional
for program code. Sections of different types are loaded into memory
in different ways by the operating system, and are subject to 
different run-time restrictions. I will explain this point
in more detail, and
illustrate different section types, in later examples.  
</p>

<pre class="codeblock" lang="asm">
.global _start
</pre>

<p>
<code>.global</code> indicates that  particular symbol, in this 
case <code>_start</code>, is to be made available to the linker. 
Unless told otherwise, the GNU linker assumes that execution should
begin at the address with the name <code>_start</code>. In this
case, <code>_start</code> is the only symbol used. 
</p>

<p>
An assembly language program starts from the defined starting address,
and continues either until told to stop, or execution runs off
the end of the code and the program crashes. The CPU won't stop
executing instructions just because the program has run out of
things for it to do -- you need to stop it explicitly.
</p>

<pre class="codeblock" lang="asm">
_start:
</pre>

<p>
This is a <i>label</i>, and its role is exactly what its name suggests 
-- it labels an address with a name. In this case, the label
<code>_start</code> is assigned to the address zero -- it must be zero,
because there has so far been no actual data or instructions
in the source code. 
</p>
<p>
Labels have many functions in assembly code. This one exists simply 
to indicate the start of the program. However, they can be used to
name function entry points, or specific variables, or targets of 
a jump ('goto'). Later examples will illustrate all these different
uses of labels.
</p>
<p>
I should point out that one of the roles of the linker is to <i>fix up</i>
labeled addresses. That is, the linker will reallocate labels to match the way
the program is to be loaded into memory. This simple program won't
start at address zero, even within its own address space  -- in 
practice some preamble will be loaded into memory ahead of the program
code. Unless you're writing a compiler, these subtleties aren't
usually too important. 
</p>
<p>
The next three instructions -- in fact, the only three instructions
in this program, comprise a <i>syscall</i>. A syscall is a way for
the program to invoke services in the operating system kernel. All
the examples in this series will use operating system services for
input and output, but there are other reasons to invoke the system.
In this case, we will do so to terminate the program. 
</p>
<p>
All syscalls follow the same basic pattern -- we load the necessary
data, including the syscall number, into one or more CPU registers,
and then use a specific instruction to execute the call.
So far as I know, there is no definitive reference for ARM Linux
syscalls, apart from the Linux kernel source. However, many people
maintain readable lists, and a web search for "arm 32 syscall table"
should produce some useful hits. It's important to realize that,
although all Linux systems of a particular version will provide
the same syscalls, they have different interfaces. Don't be
misled into trying to use information for x86/AMD64 systems.
</p>

<pre class="codeblock" lang="asm">
    mov    %r0, $42    
</pre>

<p>
<code>mov</code> ("move") is one of the must fundamental ARM instructions.
It moves data from one CPU register to another, or from a literal number.
The format is <code>mov [destination] [source]</code>. In the present
example, the operation is <i>immediate</i>. That is, the
data to be transferred is actually in the instruction itself -- that's
the number 42. The GNU assembler requires an immediate operand
to be introduced with a specific symbol -- <code>$</code>, as here, or
<code>#</code>. Unless you say otherwise, the value is treated as a
decimal number. You can use hexadecimal numbers by prefixing them
with <code>0x</code> -- as in many other programming languages -- and
there are variants for other number bases. I've tried to stick
exclusively with decimal numbers in these examples. 
</p>
<p>
<code>r0</code> is a CPU register. The GNU assembler expects a register
name to be prefixed with <code>%</code> in <code>mov</code> instructions,
although it's less picky elsewhere.
</p>
<p>
It's an interesting quirk of the ARM instruction set that an 
immediate <code>mov</code> can only specify a limited range of values.
The rules about what values are allowed are complicated, and I
won't discuss them until a later example. All you need to know at this
stage is that the assembler will warn you if you try to use an out-of-range
value.  
</p>
<p>
How do we know to use the register <code>r0</code> here? From the kernel
source, or a web search. All ARM syscalls use the same set of registers:
if the call takes one argument it is in <code>r0</code>. For two arguments
use <code>r0</code> and <code>r1</code>, and so on. I'll have more
to say about the registers and their particular functions later.
</p>
<pre class="codeblock" lang="asm">
    mov    %r7, $1    
</pre>

<p>
The 'exit' syscall to terminate the program is syscall number 1. 
The syscall number goes into register <code>r7</code>, because
lower-numbered registers are used for arguments to the call.
</p>
<pre class="codeblock" lang="asm">
   swi    $0  
</pre>

<p>
"swi" is a <b>s</b>oft<b>w</b>are <b>i</b>nterrupt. An interrupt is 
any event, software or
hardware, that causes the CPU to break its current flow of execution,
and invoke a specific handler in the kernel. Both ARM and x86 
use interrupts to invoke the kernel. This is a good choice, because
the interrupt handler runs at a higher privilege level than "ordinary"
code, and has direct access the system's hardware. Privilege level
control is one of the fundamental ways that the kernel controls 
who can do what. Interrupts usually have numbers, where the number
controls which kernel handler gets invoked. In this case, we need
interrupt zero. Notice that the assembler requires the <code>$</code>
(or <code>#</code>) prefix, because this is an immediate operand --
the number is included in the instruction.
</p>
<p>
For the record, the AMD64 architecture uses a different method
for invoking the kernel -- the instruction set has a specific
instruction for this, simply written 'syscall' in assembly language.
